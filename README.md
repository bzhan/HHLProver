### Snapshot of the HHLProver as of 2021/3/15.

Main development happens at https://gitee.com/bhzhan/mars (as part of the MARS toochain).

Outline:
- `Analysis_More`: extra lemmas in analysis.
- `BigStepSimple`: syntax, big-step semantics, Hoare rules for discrete commands.
- `BigStepContinuous`: Hoare rules for continuous commands.
- `BigStepParallel`: definition and rules for reasoning about synchronization.
- `Complete`: definition of proof system, soundness and completeness results.
- `SmallStep`: small-step semantics, equivalence with big-step semantics.
- `ExampleSimple`: examples with discrete commands.
- `ExampleContinuous`: examples with continuous commands.
- `Velocity`: velocity-control example.
- `HHLProver`: overall theory.
